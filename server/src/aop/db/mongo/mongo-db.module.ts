 * Instead of passing the DB directly, we could make use of the
 * request context that should contain a key like "tenant" or "namespace". This key would then be used
 * to connect to the right database first and pass it to the app.
 *
 * Other modules can then make use of it via `constructor(@Inject('MONGO_DB_CLIENT') private db: Db) {}`
